# Word-Guess-Game

## Overview

This is a word guess game. The [project start page](https://cnikolai.github.io/Word-Guess-Game) can be found here. 

### Problem 
This problem is a game where the user tries to guess a word that I am thinking of.  

### How I solved it
This game uses only frontend technology.  

### Technical Approach
I solved this problem by using a combination of HTML, CSS, jQuery, and Javascript.  I used HTML to create the basic page structure. I used CSS to format the page.  I stored a predetermined list of words that the user tries to guess in an array.  The user gets a predetermined number of guesses.  The computer chooses a random word from the array that the user is to guess.  The user then proceeds to guess a letter.  When the user guesses a letter from a to z, it is matched against the word to guess.  If the user wins, we play an audio clip.  If the user loses, we print out the win/loss stats, and the user can chooes to play again.
